Architecture
	Shared systems that handle both client and server
	Client only systems listen to shared systems 

	Layered (low -> high)
		Core Engine
			Utilities, different individual libraries
		Gameplay
			Component Management
				Different components and systems
			Glue
				Decides when to create components and glues together components and engine
			
Engine ideas
	render on different thread
	multithread workloads instead of everything
		do it case by case
	get tracy working

Map
	infinite procedurally generated
	generate heightmap?
		virtual textures?
	generate cities/villages
	houses:
		the-sims-like walls
		everything is an item
			but probably not terrain?

Online
	Co-op
		Not many players in a server

	Networking API done?
	
	Implement missing functionality
		Reliable vs unreliable
		reliable over udp
		always ordered
		
	Streaming terrain, houses, items, zombies

	Gameplay event system like in Robotligan - Spacially local events?

Prototype Roadmap
	Debug camera
		Send transform to server
			Write to player entity
